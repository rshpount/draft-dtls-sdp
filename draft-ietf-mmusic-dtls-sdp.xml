                This draft also defines a new SDP attribute, 'dtls-connection'. The attribute
                is used in SDP offers and answers to explicitly indicate whether a new DTLS 
                association is to be established.

            <t>
                As defined in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5763"/>, a new DTLS association 
                MUST be established when transport parameters are changed. Transport parameter change is not 
                well defined when Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" 
                pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> is used. One possible way to determine a transport change is 
                based on ufrag change, but the ufrag value is changed both when ICE is negotiated
                and when ICE restart <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> occurs. These events
                do not always require a new DTLS association to be established, but currently there is no way
                to explicitly indicate in an SDP offer or answer whether a new DTLS association is required.
                To solve that problem, this draft defines a new SDP attribute, 'dtls-connection'. The attribute 
                is used in SDP offers and answers to explicitly indicate whether a new DTLS association 
                is to be established/re-established. The attribute can be used both with and without ICE.

            A 'dtls-connection' attribute value of 'new' indicates that a new
            DTLS association MUST be established. A 'dtls-connection' attribute
            value of 'existing' indicates that a new DTLS association MUST NOT be
            established.

        <t>
            Unlike the SDP 'connection' attribute for TLS, there is no default
            value defined for the 'dtls-connection' attribute.  Implementations
            that wish to use the attribute MUST explicitly include it in SDP
            offers and answers. If an offer or answer does not contain an
            attribute, other means needs to be used in order for endpoints to
            determine whether an offer or answer is associated with an event that
            requires the DTLS association to be re-established.

                This section defines the generic SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating
                a DTLS association. Additional procedures (e.g. regarding usage of usage specific SDP 
                attributes etc) for individual DTLS usages (e.g. SRTP-DTLS) are outside the scope 
                of this specification, and needs to be specified in a usage specific specification.
            </t>
            <t>
                NOTE: The procedures in this section are generalizations of procedures first 
                specified in SRTP-DTLS <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5763"/>, 
                with the addition of usage of the SDP 'dtls-connection' attribute. That document is
                herein revised to make use of these new procedures.
            </t>
			<t>
                The procedures in this section apply to an SDP media description ("m=" line) associated 
                a DTLS-protected media/data stream.				
			</t>
			<t>
                In order to negotiate a DTLS association, the following SDP attributes are used:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        The SDP 'setup' attribute, defined in <xref target="RFC4145" pageno="false" 
                        format="default" />, is used to negotiate the DTLS roles;
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The SDP 'fingerprint' attribute, defined in <xref target="RFC4572" 
                        pageno="false" format="default" />, is used to provide the fingerprint
                        value; and
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        The SDP 'dtls-connection' attribute, defined in this specification, is
                        used to explicitly indicate whether a new DTLS association is to be
                        established or whether a previous association is to be used.
                    </t>
                </list>
			</t>
			<t>
				Endpoints MUST NOT use the SDP 'connection' attribute 
				<xref target="RFC4145" pageno="false" format="default" />
                when negotiating a DTLS association.
			</t>
            <t>
                The SDP 'connection' attribute MAY be used if the usage
                is associated with another protocol layer, e.g. SCTP or TCP, used
                together with DTLS.
            </t>
            <t>
                Unlike for TCP and TLS connections, endpoints MUST NOT use the 
                SDP 'setup' attribute 'holdconn' value when negotiating a DTLS association.
            </t>
            <t>
                Endpoints MUST support SHA-256 for generating and verifying the fingerprint
                value associated with the DTLS association. The use of SHA-256 is preferred. 
            </t>
            <t>
                Endpoints MUST, at a minimum, support TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 
				and MUST support TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256. UDPTL over DTLS MUST 
				prefer TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and any other Perfect Forward Secrecy 
				(PFS) cipher suites over non-PFS cipher suites. Implementations SHOULD disable 
				TLS-level compression.
			</t>
			<t>
				The certificate received during the DTLS handshake MUST match 
				the fingerprint received in the SDP "fingerprint" attribute. If the fingerprint 
				does not match the hashed certificate, then the endpoint MUST tear down the media 
				session immediately. Note that it is permissible to wait until the other side's 
				fingerprint has been received before establishing the connection; however, this 
				may have undesirable latency effects.

                When the offerer sends the initial offer, and the offerer wants to establish a

                in the offer. In addition, the offerer MUST insert an SDP 'setup' attribute according 
                to the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4145"/>, and

Update to section 5:
--------------------                

OLD TEXT:

5.  Establishing a Secure Channel

   The two endpoints in the exchange present their identities as part of
   the DTLS handshake procedure using certificates.  This document uses
   certificates in the same style as described in "Connection-Oriented
   Media Transport over the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol in
   the Session Description Protocol (SDP)" [RFC4572].

   If self-signed certificates are used, the content of the
   subjectAltName attribute inside the certificate MAY use the uniform
   resource identifier (URI) of the user.  This is useful for debugging
   purposes only and is not required to bind the certificate to one of
   the communication endpoints.  The integrity of the certificate is
   ensured through the fingerprint attribute in the SDP.  The
   subjectAltName is not an important component of the certificate
   verification.

   The generation of public/private key pairs is relatively expensive.
   Endpoints are not required to generate certificates for each session.

   The offer/answer model, defined in [RFC3264], is used by protocols
   like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] to set up
   multimedia sessions.  In addition to the usual contents of an SDP
   [RFC4566] message, each media description ("m=" line and associated
   parameters) will also contain several attributes as specified in
   [RFC5764], [RFC4145], and [RFC4572].

   When an endpoint wishes to set up a secure media session with another
   endpoint, it sends an offer in a SIP message to the other endpoint.
   This offer includes, as part of the SDP payload, the fingerprint of
   the certificate that the endpoint wants to use.  The endpoint SHOULD
   send the SIP message containing the offer to the offerer's SIP proxy
   over an integrity protected channel.  The proxy SHOULD add an
   Identity header field according to the procedures outlined in
   [RFC4474].  The SIP message containing the offer SHOULD be sent to
   the offerer's SIP proxy over an integrity protected channel.  When
   the far endpoint receives the SIP message, it can verify the identity
   of the sender using the Identity header field.  Since the Identity
   header field is a digital signature across several SIP header fields,
   in addition to the body of the SIP message, the receiver can also be
   certain that the message has not been tampered with after the digital
   signature was applied and added to the SIP message.

   The far endpoint (answerer) may now establish a DTLS association with
   the offerer.  Alternately, it can indicate in its answer that the
   offerer is to initiate the TLS association.  In either case, mutual
   DTLS certificate-based authentication will be used.  After completing
   the DTLS handshake, information about the authenticated identities,
   including the certificates, are made available to the endpoint
   application.  The answerer is then able to verify that the offerer's
   certificate used for authentication in the DTLS handshake can be
   associated to the certificate fingerprint contained in the offer in
   the SDP.  At this point, the answerer may indicate to the end user
   that the media is secured.  The offerer may only tentatively accept
   the answerer's certificate since it may not yet have the answerer's
   certificate fingerprint.

   When the answerer accepts the offer, it provides an answer back to
   the offerer containing the answerer's certificate fingerprint.  At
   this point, the offerer can accept or reject the peer's certificate
   and the offerer can indicate to the end user that the media is
   secured.

   Note that the entire authentication and key exchange for securing the
   media traffic is handled in the media path through DTLS.  The
   signaling path is only used to verify the peers' certificate
   fingerprints.

   The offer and answer MUST conform to the following requirements.

   o  The endpoint MUST use the setup attribute defined in [RFC4145].
      The endpoint that is the offerer MUST use the setup attribute
      value of setup:actpass and be prepared to receive a client_hello
      before it receives the answer.  The answerer MUST use either a
      setup attribute value of setup:active or setup:passive.  Note that
      if the answerer uses setup:passive, then the DTLS handshake will
      not begin until the answerer is received, which adds additional
      latency. setup:active allows the answer and the DTLS handshake to
      occur in parallel.  Thus, setup:active is RECOMMENDED.  Whichever
      party is active MUST initiate a DTLS handshake by sending a
      ClientHello over each flow (host/port quartet).

   o  The endpoint MUST NOT use the connection attribute defined in
      [RFC4145].

   o  The endpoint MUST use the certificate fingerprint attribute as
      specified in [RFC4572].

   o  The certificate presented during the DTLS handshake MUST match the
      fingerprint exchanged via the signaling path in the SDP.  The
      security properties of this mechanism are described in Section 8.

   o  If the fingerprint does not match the hashed certificate, then the
      endpoint MUST tear down the media session immediately.  Note that
      it is permissible to wait until the other side's fingerprint has
      been received before establishing the connection; however, this
      may have undesirable latency effects.

Update to section 6.6:

OLD TEXT:

6.6.  Session Modification

   Once an answer is provided to the offerer, either endpoint MAY
   request a session modification that MAY include an updated offer.
   This session modification can be carried in either an INVITE or
   UPDATE request.  The peers can reuse the existing associations if
   they are compatible (i.e., they have the same key fingerprints and
   transport parameters), or establish a new one following the same
   rules are for initial exchanges, tearing down the existing
   association as soon as the offer/answer exchange is completed.  Note
   that if the active/passive status of the endpoints changes, a new
   connection MUST be established.

   or establish a new one, following the procedures in [RFCXXXX].

Update to section 6.7.1:

OLD TEXT:

6.7.1.  ICE Interaction

   Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), as specified in
   [RFC5245], provides a methodology of allowing participants in
   multimedia sessions to verify mutual connectivity.  When ICE is being
   used, the ICE connectivity checks are performed before the DTLS
   handshake begins.  Note that if aggressive nomination mode is used,
   multiple candidate pairs may be marked valid before ICE finally
   converges on a single candidate pair.  Implementations MUST treat all
   ICE candidate pairs associated with a single component as part of the
   same DTLS association.  Thus, there will be only one DTLS handshake
   even if there are multiple valid candidate pairs.  Note that this may
   mean adjusting the endpoint IP addresses if the selected candidate
   pair shifts, just as if the DTLS packets were an ordinary media
   stream.

   Note that Simple Traversal of the UDP Protocol through NAT (STUN)
   packets are sent directly over UDP, not over DTLS.  [RFC5764]
   describes how to demultiplex STUN packets from DTLS packets and SRTP
   packets.

Update to section 4:
--------------------
                
OLD TEXT:

4.  SDP Offerer/Answerer Procedures

4.1.  General

   An endpoint (i.e., both the offerer and the answerer) MUST create an
   SDP media description ("m=" line) for each UDPTL-over-DTLS media
   stream and MUST assign a UDP/TLS/UDPTL value (see Table 1) to the
   "proto" field of the "m=" line.

   The procedures in this section apply to an "m=" line associated with
   a UDPTL-over-DTLS media stream.

   In order to negotiate a UDPTL-over-DTLS media stream, the following
   SDP attributes are used:

   o  The SDP attributes defined for UDPTL over UDP, as described in
      [ITU.T38.2010]; and

   o  The SDP attributes, defined in [RFC4145] and [RFC4572], as
      described in this section.

   The endpoint MUST NOT use the SDP "connection" attribute [RFC4145].

   In order to negotiate the TLS roles for the UDPTL-over-DTLS transport
   connection, the endpoint MUST use the SDP "setup" attribute
   [RFC4145].

   If the endpoint supports, and is willing to use, a cipher suite with
   an associated certificate, the endpoint MUST include an SDP
   "fingerprint" attribute [RFC4572].  The endpoint MUST support SHA-256
   for generating and verifying the SDP "fingerprint" attribute value.
   The use of SHA-256 is preferred.  UDPTL over DTLS, at a minimum, MUST
   support TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and MUST support
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.  UDPTL over DTLS MUST prefer
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and any other Perfect Forward
   Secrecy (PFS) cipher suites over non-PFS cipher suites.
   Implementations SHOULD disable TLS-level compression.

   If a cipher suite with an associated certificate is selected during
   the DTLS handshake, the certificate received during the DTLS
   handshake MUST match the fingerprint received in the SDP
   "fingerprint" attribute.  If the fingerprint does not match the
   hashed certificate, then the endpoint MUST tear down the media
   session immediately.  Note that it is permissible to wait until the
   other side's fingerprint has been received before establishing the
   connection; however, this may have undesirable latency effects.

4.2.  Generating the Initial Offer

   The offerer SHOULD assign the SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "actpass", unless the offerer insists on being either the sender or
   receiver of the DTLS ClientHello message, in which case the offerer
   can use either a value of "active" (the offerer will be the sender of
   ClientHello) or "passive" (the offerer will be the receiver of
   ClientHello).  The offerer MUST NOT assign an SDP "setup" attribute
   with a "holdconn" value.

   If the offerer assigns the SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "actpass" or "passive", the offerer MUST be prepared to receive a
   DTLS ClientHello message before it receives the SDP answer.

4.3.  Generating the Answer

   If the answerer accepts the offered UDPTL-over-DTLS transport
   connection, in the associated SDP answer, the answerer MUST assign an
   SDP "setup" attribute with a value of either "active" or "passive",
   according to the procedures in [RFC4145].  The answerer MUST NOT
   assign an SDP "setup" attribute with a value of "holdconn".

   If the answerer assigns an SDP "setup" attribute with a value of
   "active" value, the answerer MUST initiate a DTLS handshake by
   sending a DTLS ClientHello message on the negotiated media stream,
   towards the IP address and port of the offerer.

4.4.  Offerer Processing of the Answer

   When the offerer receives an SDP answer, if the offerer ends up being
   active it MUST initiate a DTLS handshake by sending a DTLS
   ClientHello message on the negotiated media stream, towards the IP
   address and port of the answerer.

4.5.  Modifying the Session

   Once an offer/answer exchange has been completed, either endpoint MAY
   send a new offer in order to modify the session.  The endpoints can
   reuse the existing DTLS association if the key fingerprint values and
   transport parameters indicated by each endpoint are unchanged.
   Otherwise, following the rules for the initial offer/answer exchange,
   the endpoints can negotiate and create a new DTLS association and,
   once created, delete the previous DTLS association, following the
   same rules for the initial offer/answer exchange.  Each endpoint
   needs to be prepared to receive data on both the new and old DTLS
   associations as long as both are alive.
   
NEW TEXT:

4.  SDP Offerer/Answerer Procedures

   An endpoint (i.e., both the offerer and the answerer) MUST create an
   SDP media description ("m=" line) for each UDPTL-over-DTLS media
   stream and MUST assign a UDP/TLS/UDPTL value (see Table 1) to the
   "proto" field of the "m=" line.

   The offerer and answerer MUST follow the SDP offer/answer procedures
   defined in [RFCXXXX] in order to negotiate the DTLS association
   associated with the UDPTL-over-DTLS media stream. In addition,
   the offerer and answerer MUST use the SDP attributes defined for
   UDPTL over UDP, as defined in [ITU.T38.2010].

5.2.1.  ICE Usage

   When Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] is being

   multiple candidate pairs may be marked valid before ICE finally

   handshake even if there are multiple valid candidate pairs.  Note
   that this may mean adjusting the endpoint IP addresses if the
   selected candidate pair shifts, just as if the DTLS packets were an
   ordinary media stream.  In the case of an ICE restart, the DTLS
   handshake procedure is repeated, and a new DTLS association is
   created.  Once the DTLS handshake is completed and the new DTLS
   association has been created, the previous DTLS association is
   deleted.
